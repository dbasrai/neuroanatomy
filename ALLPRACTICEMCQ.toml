    hint = "Both are slender processes that extend from the neuron cell body"
    explanation = """
    An axon originates at the neuron cell body axon hillock and extends to other neurons. An axon terminates in branches that have presynaptic specializations which release neurotransmitter when an action potential is conducted to them. Often, many dendrites extend from the neuron cell body and branch widely to receive axon terminal neurotransmitter at their postsynaptic specializations, which contain receptors and channels that respond to the neurotransmitter release by an axon terminal.
