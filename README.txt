The file quiz.py is a Python program that generates random multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from the NUIN 440 question pool, which is found in the ALLPRACTICEMCQ file, a ‘.toml ‘or ‘.txt’ file that must be put in the same folder as the program. The quiz program provides hints, explanations, and feedback about performance.

To run the program, you will need Python 3 and a suitable interactive development environment (IDE) such as Thonny. A Thonny download includes Python 3. The program should work in any recent Windows, Mac OS, or Linux system. You may need to import Python modules, for example tomllib or tomli, depending on your system. Questions and feedback appear in the IDE “shell” window, and your answers are put in that window.

If you prefer to work from files or paper copies, there is a version of quiz.py, the file quizwriter.py, that writes multiple choice quiz question files and answer files. You can use it to make any number of quizzes that have question and answer orders randomly scrambled for each quiz. The quizzes found at the course cloud site were made with this program.

The quiz program is a work in progress, and your help in improving it is needed. Please report to Jim Baker any experiences you have with the quiz program or its quizzes that might help in its development. Contact Jim Baker if you have any questions. Feel free to modify the program to your liking. If you succeed in making a stand-alone version that does not require users to have Python installed, this is sorely needed, so let us know how you did it!
