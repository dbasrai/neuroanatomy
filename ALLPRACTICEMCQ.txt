    explanation = """
    An axon originates at the neuron cell body axon hillock and extends to other neurons. An axon terminates in branches that have presynaptic specializations which release neurotransmitter when an action potential is conducted to them. Often, many dendrites extend from the neuron cell body and branch widely to receive axon terminal neurotransmitter at their postsynaptic specializations, which contain receptors and channels that respond to the neurotransmitter release by an axon terminal.

    An expanding syrinx can block blood circulation to most of the spinal cord bilaterally, except for the dorsal columns, which are supplied by the dorsally located posterior spinal arteries. The expansion first disables motor function near the level of the syrinx, then the descending axons of the corticospinal tracts in the dorsolateral white matter. The syrinx has then effectively blocked the areas served by the midline anterior spinal artery and there is a descending paralysis or severe paresis of all lower body parts.

    A blockage of the anterior spinal artery, the vertebral artery, or the basilar artery can deprive the ventral and medial medulla of oxygen and result in medial medullary syndrome. The pyramid is affected because it is at the ventral surface, the hypoglossal nerve is affected, because this somatic motor nerve courses medially to exit ventrally, and the medial lemniscus is affected, because it lies as a dorsal to ventral ribbon adjacent to the midline of the rostral medulla. The pyramidal damage causes contralateral body paresis, the hypoglossal damage causes tongue weakness and deviation to the side of the lesion, and the medial lemniscus damage causes loss of touch, pressure, vibration, and position sense on the contralateral side of the body.

    Circadian rhythms of sleep and wakefulness are governed by suprachiasmatic nucleus activity that follows a 24 hour cycle.

Suprachiasmatic nucleus output is relayed via the hypothalamus, intermediolateral cell column, and superior cervical ganglion to the pineal gland, which secretes melatonin to promote sleep. Damage to the suprachiasmatic nucleus disrupts sleep, resulting in very irregular sleep patterns.

    The occipital lobe is visual. It receives input relayed from the retina by the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus. The temporal lobe also has visual functions, related to higher level processing, for example face recognition by the ventral occipito-temporal cortex or fusiform gyrus. The temporal lobe also has the primary auditory cortex and higher auditory areas. Wernickes language area on the left hemisphere is mainly in the temporal lobe. Much of temporal lobe information is directed to the hippocampus and amygdala of the limbic system. The parietal lobe also has some of Wernickes area. The parietal lobe is mostly concerned with multi-modal sensory integration, attention, and spatial aspects of motor control. The frontal lobe has primary motor cortex and premotor areas. More anterior, dorsolateral, and ventral on the frontal lobe are areas that serve the highest executive functions, decision-making, and short term memory.

    The output neurons of cerebellar cortex, the Purkinje cells, project GABA-ergic axons to the cerebellar deep nuclei. The deep nuclei lie within the cerebellar white matter. Deep nuclear cell axons are the output from the cerebellum, projected mainly to the ventral lateral thalamus to be relayed to motor areas of cortex. The deep nuclei from medial to lateral are the fastigial nucleus, the interposed nuclei (or globose and emboliform nucleus), and the very large dentate nucleus.

    The flocculonodular lobe (vestibulocerebellum) and the vermis, medial cerebellum, are most closely associated with trunk coordination, postural tone, trunk ataxia, and loss of balance. The vermis has a region devoted to control of saccadic eye movements. The intermediate zone between the vermis and hemispheres is most related to limb function and limb ataxia, abnormal gait, or limb coordination.

    The nodulus and flocculus comprise the vestibulocerebellum or flocculonodular lobe. The flocculus is required for adaptive adjustment of the vestibulo-ocular reflex and for visual pursuit, the ability to smoothly follow a moving visual target. Only primates have visual pursuit. Non-primates follow moving targets with a series of saccades. Suppression of saccades and other saccade planning is primarily a function of the frontal cortex eye field area. The short latency, automatic generation of saccades is dependent on the superior colliculus.

    explanation = """
    Humans with bilateral hippocampal lesions, such as H.M. and R.B., are unable to acquire new declarative memories. That is, they cannot learn new facts, events, people, or places. This deficit includes an inability to learn directions to a new location. Animals with bilateral hippocampal lesions cannot learn new spatial navigation tasks, such as radial arm mazes and the Morris water maze.

    hint = "Animal studies have elucidated roles of the two major limbic centers"
    explanation = """
    Lesion studies in animals have distinguished functions of the two major limbic centers, the hippocampus and amygdala. Animals with bilateral hippocampal lesions cannot learn new spatial navigation tasks, such as radial arm mazes and the Morris water maze. Animals with bilateral amygdala lesions do not show fear responses and do not learn fear conditioning tasks, such as freezing to a tone that signals an impending electric shock.
